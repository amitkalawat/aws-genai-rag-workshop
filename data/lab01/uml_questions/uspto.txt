    Description:
    This set of APIs allows clients to interact with a data set management system. The main API is represented by the `/` path, which enables clients to list available data sets using the `GET` method. The response returns a list of data set IDs along with a status code of 200 for success. Another API endpoint is `/datasets/{version}/fields`, which allows clients to retrieve a list of searchable fields for a given data set and version using the `GET` method. The response includes a string value containing the list of searchable fields and a status code of 200 for success or 404 if the data set or version is not found. The third API endpoint is `/datasets/{version}/records`, which enables clients to perform a search on a data set using the `POST` method. The request body includes the search criteria, start index, and number of rows to return. The response contains a map with the search results and a status code of 200 for success or 404 if the data set or version is not found.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of this set of APIs?

These APIs allow clients to interact with a data set management system, enabling them to list available data sets, retrieve searchable fields for a specific data set and version, and perform searches on data sets.

How do I list all available data sets?

To list all available data sets, send a GET request to the `/` endpoint. The response will contain a list of data set IDs.

How do I get the searchable fields for a particular data set and version?

To retrieve the list of searchable fields for a specific data set and version, send a GET request to the `/datasets/{version}/fields` endpoint, replacing `{version}` with the desired version number. The response will contain a string value with the list of searchable fields.

What is the purpose of the `/datasets/{version}/records` endpoint?

The `/datasets/{version}/records` endpoint allows clients to perform a search on a data set. Send a POST request to this endpoint with the search criteria, start index, and number of rows to return in the request body. The response will contain the search results.

What data structure is used for the search request body?

The search request body is a JSON object with three properties: `criteria` (a string containing the search criteria), `start` (an integer representing the starting index for the search results), and `rows` (an integer specifying the number of rows to return).

What status codes can be returned by these APIs?

The APIs can return a status code of 200 for success, or 404 if the requested data set or version is not found.

How do I handle errors or unsuccessful responses from these APIs?

If a 404 status code is returned, it means that the requested data set or version was not found. You should handle this error case appropriately in your client application. Other potential errors could include invalid request bodies or server-side issues, which should also be handled gracefully.

Can I use these APIs to create, update, or delete data sets?

Based on the provided information, these APIs do not seem to support creating, updating, or deleting data sets. They are limited to listing available data sets, retrieving searchable fields, and performing searches on existing data sets.

What is the purpose of the `dataSetList.apis` object?

The `dataSetList.apis` object contains metadata about the APIs themselves, including the API key, version number, URI, and documentation URI. This information could be useful for clients interacting with the APIs programmatically or for documentation purposes.

Are there any limits or restrictions on the number of searches or results I can retrieve?

The provided information does not mention any specific limits or restrictions on the number of searches or results that can be retrieved. However, it is generally a good practice to implement reasonable limits and error handling in your API to prevent abuse or excessive load on the server.

How do I authenticate or authorize requests to these APIs?

The provided information does not mention any authentication or authorization mechanisms for these APIs. It is possible that authentication is handled at a higher level or through other means not specified in the provided documentation.

Can I search across multiple data sets or versions simultaneously?

Based on the provided information, it does not appear that these APIs support searching across multiple data sets or versions simultaneously. You would need to perform separate searches for each data set and version combination.

Are there any caching mechanisms or performance optimizations implemented in these APIs?

The provided documentation does not mention any specific caching mechanisms or performance optimizations implemented in these APIs. However, it is common practice to implement caching and other performance optimizations in production APIs to improve response times and reduce server load.

Can I sort or filter the search results returned by the `/datasets/{version}/records` endpoint?

The provided information does not specify any options for sorting or filtering the search results returned by the `/datasets/{version}/records` endpoint. The search results are likely returned in the order determined by the underlying data set and search implementation.

How do I handle pagination or retrieve additional pages of search results?

The provided documentation does not mention any specific mechanisms for pagination or retrieving additional pages of search results. One potential approach could be to use the `start` and `rows` parameters in the search request to control the starting index and number of results returned, and make subsequent requests as needed to retrieve additional pages.

Are there any versioning mechanisms or compatibility considerations for these APIs?

The APIs appear to have a versioning mechanism in place, as evidenced by the `{version}` parameter in the `/datasets/{version}/fields` and `/datasets/{version}/records` endpoints. Clients should be aware of potential compatibility issues when interacting with different API versions and handle versioning appropriately in their applications.

Can I retrieve metadata or schema information about the data sets or searchable fields?

The provided documentation does not mention any specific endpoints or mechanisms for retrieving metadata or schema information about the data sets or searchable fields. This information may need to be obtained through other means or documented separately.

Are there any testing or debugging tools or resources available for these APIs?

The provided documentation does not mention any specific testing or debugging tools or resources for these APIs. However, many API providers offer tools such as API explorers, testing sandboxes, or developer portals to assist with testing and debugging their APIs.

Can I extend or customize the functionality of these APIs in any way?

The provided documentation does not mention any mechanisms for extending or customizing the functionality of these APIs. Without access to the source code or additional documentation, the APIs are likely intended to be used as-is without customization.
