    Description:
    The API specification provides a set of endpoints for managing datasets and performing searches within those datasets. The GET /datasets endpoint retrieves a list of available datasets. The GET /{dataset}/{version}/fields endpoint returns a list of searchable fields for a specific dataset and version. The POST /{dataset}/{version}/records endpoint allows performing a search within a dataset and version, accepting criteria such as search criteria, start index, and number of rows to return. The responses include appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 404 for not found) and data structures containing either the requested information or error details.
    - Number of routes/endpoints: 3
- Number of request data models: 1 (perform-search Request)
- Number of response data models: 3 (list-searchable-fields 200, list-searchable-fields 404, perform-search 200)
- The dataSetList model contains a list of APIs with details like API key, version number, URI, and documentation URI.
    
    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of this API?

The API provides functionality to retrieve a list of available datasets, get searchable fields for a specific dataset and version, and perform searches within those datasets.

How do I get a list of available datasets?

You can send a GET request to the /datasets endpoint to retrieve a list of available datasets.

How can I find out the searchable fields for a particular dataset and version?

Send a GET request to the /{dataset}/{version}/fields endpoint, replacing {dataset} and {version} with the desired dataset and version values. The response will contain a list of searchable fields for that dataset and version.

What information do I need to provide to perform a search?

To perform a search, send a POST request to the /{dataset}/{version}/records endpoint with a request body containing the search criteria, start index, and number of rows to return.

What is the structure of the request body for performing a search?

The request body for performing a search should be a JSON object with the following properties: 'criteria' (a string representing the search criteria), 'start' (an integer for the start index), and 'rows' (an integer for the number of rows to return).

What does the response look like for a successful search?

If the search is successful (HTTP status code 200), the response will be a JSON object with a 'value' property containing a map of key-value pairs representing the search results.

How are errors handled in this API?

Errors are indicated by appropriate HTTP status codes, such as 404 (Not Found) for invalid dataset or version values. The response will also include an error message providing more details about the error.

Are there any limits on the number of search results?

The API specification does not mention any explicit limits on the number of search results. However, it is recommended to use reasonable values for the 'rows' parameter to avoid overloading the server or receiving an excessive amount of data.

Can I search across multiple datasets or versions at once?

No, the API specification indicates that searches are performed within a specific dataset and version. To search across multiple datasets or versions, you would need to make separate requests for each combination.

How do I authenticate with this API?

The API specification does not provide details about authentication mechanisms. It is likely that authentication would be required, such as through API keys or tokens, but the specifics are not mentioned in the provided information.

What data formats are supported for requests and responses?

Based on the provided information, the requests and responses appear to use JSON format for data exchange. However, the API specification does not explicitly mention supported data formats.

Can I get more detailed documentation for these APIs?

The API specification does not provide direct links to detailed documentation. However, the dataSetList model includes a property 'apiDocumentationUri' which may contain a URI pointing to additional documentation for each API.

How can I test these APIs before integrating them into my application?

The API specification does not mention any testing or sandbox environments. You may need to set up a local or development environment to test the APIs before integrating them into your application.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place?

The API specification does not provide any information about rate limits or throttling mechanisms. However, it is common for APIs to implement such measures to prevent abuse or overloading of the system.

Can I get real-time updates or notifications for changes in the datasets?

The API specification does not mention any real-time update or notification mechanisms. The APIs appear to be designed for retrieving and searching datasets, but not for receiving updates or changes.

How can I sort or filter the search results?

The API specification does not provide any details about sorting or filtering search results. The search functionality seems to be limited to performing basic searches based on the provided criteria.

Are there any caching mechanisms in place for frequently accessed data?

The API specification does not mention any caching mechanisms. However, caching is a common practice to improve performance and reduce server load for frequently accessed data.

Can I perform partial or fuzzy searches?

The API specification does not provide information about partial or fuzzy search capabilities. The search functionality appears to be based on exact matching of the provided search criteria.

How can I debug issues or get support for these APIs?

The API specification does not include any information about debugging or support channels. You may need to consult additional documentation or contact the API provider for assistance with debugging or support-related issues.

Are there any versioning mechanisms in place for these APIs?

Yes, the API specification includes version numbers as part of the endpoints (/{dataset}/{version}/fields and /{dataset}/{version}/records). This suggests that versioning mechanisms are in place to handle changes or updates to the APIs.
