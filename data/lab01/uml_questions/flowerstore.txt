    Description:
    The provided image depicts the specification for a set of APIs related to managing flowers. The APIs include the following endpoints:

- GET /flowers: Retrieves a list of flowers with pagination support. It takes two query parameters: `type` (a string array) and `limit` (an integer).

- GET /flowers/{id}: Retrieves details of a specific flower identified by its ID. The request takes an `id` path parameter of type integer.

- POST /flowers: Creates a new flower. The request body should contain the `name` (string), `type` (string), and `price` (decimal) properties of the new flower.

- DELETE /flowers/{id}: Deletes a flower identified by its ID. The request takes an `id` path parameter of type integer.

The response data models include:

- Flower: Represents a single flower with properties like `id` (integer), `name` (string), `type` (string), and `price` (decimal).

- Error: Represents an error response with properties like `code` (integer) and `message` (string).

The APIs may encounter errors, such as when attempting to retrieve or delete a non-existent flower ID. In such cases, an Error response with an appropriate error code and message will be returned.
    - Number of routes/endpoints: 4
- Number of request data models: 1 (NewFlower)
- Number of response data models: 2 (Flower, Error)
- Number of path parameters: 2 (id for GET /flowers/{id} and DELETE /flowers/{id})
- Number of query parameters: 2 (type and limit for GET /flowers)
    
    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of the GET /flowers endpoint?

The GET /flowers endpoint is used to retrieve a list of flowers. It supports pagination through the `limit` query parameter, which determines the maximum number of flowers to return. Additionally, you can filter the flowers by their `type` using the `type` query parameter, which accepts an array of string values.

How do I create a new flower?

To create a new flower, send a POST request to the /flowers endpoint with a request body containing the `name` (string), `type` (string), and `price` (decimal) properties of the new flower.

What information is included in the response for a single flower?

When retrieving details of a single flower using the GET /flowers/{id} endpoint, the response will include an object representing the flower with properties like `id` (integer), `name` (string), `type` (string), and `price` (decimal).

How do I delete a flower?

To delete a flower, send a DELETE request to the /flowers/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the flower you want to delete.

What happens if I try to retrieve or delete a flower that doesn't exist?

If you attempt to retrieve or delete a flower using an ID that doesn't exist, the API will respond with an Error object containing an appropriate error code and message explaining the issue.

Can I filter the list of flowers by multiple types?

Yes, the `type` query parameter for the GET /flowers endpoint accepts an array of string values. This allows you to filter the list of flowers by multiple types simultaneously.

What is the expected format for the `price` property when creating a new flower?

The `price` property for the new flower should be provided as a decimal value, which represents the price of the flower.

Is there a limit to the number of flowers that can be retrieved with the GET /flowers endpoint?

Yes, the `limit` query parameter for the GET /flowers endpoint allows you to specify the maximum number of flowers to be returned in the response. If no `limit` is provided, a default limit may be applied by the API.

How do I know if a request was successful or not?

If a request is successful, the API will return a response with the appropriate data structure (e.g., a list of flowers or a single flower object). If there is an error, the API will return an Error object containing an error code and message explaining the issue.

Can I update an existing flower?

Based on the provided information, there is no endpoint dedicated to updating an existing flower. However, you could potentially implement an update functionality by sending a PUT or PATCH request to the /flowers/{id} endpoint with the updated flower data in the request body.

What data types are used for the `id` property of a flower?

The `id` property of a flower is an integer value, which uniquely identifies each flower.

Is there a way to retrieve all flowers without any pagination or filtering?

The provided information does not explicitly mention a way to retrieve all flowers without pagination or filtering. However, you could potentially send a GET /flowers request with a very large `limit` value and without any `type` filter to retrieve a substantial portion of the flowers, if not all.

Can I create multiple flowers in a single request?

No, the provided information indicates that the POST /flowers endpoint is used to create a single new flower at a time. There is no explicit support for creating multiple flowers in a single request.

What happens if I try to create a new flower with missing or invalid data?

If you attempt to create a new flower with missing or invalid data (e.g., missing `name` or `type`, or invalid `price` format), the API is likely to respond with an Error object containing an appropriate error code and message explaining the issue with the request data.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for these APIs?

The provided information does not mention any rate limits or throttling mechanisms for these APIs. However, it is a common practice for APIs to have some form of rate limiting or throttling to prevent abuse and maintain performance.

Can I sort the list of flowers returned by the GET /flowers endpoint?

The provided information does not mention any sorting capabilities for the GET /flowers endpoint. The flowers may be returned in an arbitrary order unless the API provides additional query parameters or headers for sorting the results.

What HTTP status codes can I expect in the responses from these APIs?

The provided information does not explicitly mention the HTTP status codes used in the responses. However, based on standard practices, you can expect status codes like 200 OK for successful requests, 404 Not Found for resources that don't exist, 400 Bad Request for invalid request data, and 500 Internal Server Error for server-side issues.

Is there any authentication or authorization mechanism required to use these APIs?

The provided information does not mention any authentication or authorization mechanisms for these APIs. However, in real-world scenarios, APIs often require some form of authentication, such as API keys, OAuth, or JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to control access and ensure security.

Can I use these APIs to manage other types of entities besides flowers?

Based on the provided information, these APIs are specifically designed to manage flowers. There is no indication that they can be used to manage other types of entities without modifications or additions to the API specification.

Are there any validation rules or constraints for the `name` and `type` properties of a flower?

The provided information does not specify any validation rules or constraints for the `name` and `type` properties of a flower. However, it is common for APIs to enforce certain rules, such as allowing only alphanumeric characters, limiting string lengths, or enforcing specific patterns or formats.
