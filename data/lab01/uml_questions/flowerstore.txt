    Description:
    The provided images depict the structure and specifications for a set of APIs related to managing flowers. The main API endpoint is '/flowers', which supports GET, POST, and DELETE operations. The GET operation retrieves a list of flowers, taking two parameters: 'type' (a string array) to filter by flower types, and 'limit' (an integer) to control the maximum number of results. The response is a '200' status code with an array of 'Flower' objects, each containing an 'id' (integer) property. The POST operation creates a new flower, accepting a 'NewFlower' object in the request body with properties like 'name' (string), 'type' (string), and 'price' (decimal). On success, it returns a '200' status code with the created 'Flower' object. The DELETE operation removes a flower by its 'id', returning a '204' status code on success. Additionally, there's a '/flowers/{id}' endpoint for GET and DELETE operations on individual flowers. Potential errors include a generic 'Error' object with 'code' (integer) and 'message' (string) properties.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of these APIs?

These APIs are designed for managing flowers, allowing users to retrieve lists of flowers, create new flowers, and delete existing flowers.

How do I get a list of flowers?

To get a list of flowers, send a GET request to the '/flowers' endpoint. You can optionally include the 'type' query parameter to filter by flower types (as a string array), and the 'limit' query parameter to control the maximum number of results.

What does the response look like for the GET '/flowers' endpoint?

The response for the GET '/flowers' endpoint is an array of 'Flower' objects, each containing an 'id' (integer) property. The response status code is '200' on success.

How do I create a new flower?

To create a new flower, send a POST request to the '/flowers' endpoint with a 'NewFlower' object in the request body. This object should contain the 'name' (string), 'type' (string), and 'price' (decimal) properties of the new flower.

What is the response for a successful flower creation?

If the flower creation is successful, the response will have a '200' status code and will contain the newly created 'Flower' object.

How do I delete a flower?

To delete a flower, send a DELETE request to either the '/flowers/{id}' endpoint (for a specific flower) or the '/flowers' endpoint (for all flowers). For the '/flowers/{id}' endpoint, you need to provide the 'id' of the flower you want to delete as a path parameter.

What is the response for a successful flower deletion?

If the flower deletion is successful, the response will have a '204' status code with no response body.

What are the possible error responses?

The APIs can return an 'Error' object as an error response, which contains a 'code' (integer) and 'message' (string) property. The specific error codes and messages are not provided in the given information.

Can I update an existing flower?

Based on the provided information, there is no endpoint or operation for updating an existing flower. The APIs only support creating, retrieving, and deleting flowers.

Are there any limits on the number of flowers I can retrieve?

Yes, when making a GET request to the '/flowers' endpoint, you can use the 'limit' query parameter to control the maximum number of flower results returned.

What data types are used for the flower properties?

The 'Flower' object has an 'id' property of type integer. The 'NewFlower' object used for creating a flower has 'name' (string), 'type' (string), and 'price' (decimal) properties.

Can I filter the list of flowers by multiple types?

Yes, when making a GET request to the '/flowers' endpoint, you can provide the 'type' query parameter as a string array to filter the results by multiple flower types.

What is the purpose of the '/flowers/{id}' endpoint?

The '/flowers/{id}' endpoint allows you to perform GET and DELETE operations on a specific flower identified by its 'id' value, which is provided as a path parameter.

Can I retrieve a single flower by its ID?

Yes, you can retrieve a single flower by sending a GET request to the '/flowers/{id}' endpoint, replacing '{id}' with the desired flower ID.

Are there any authentication or authorization requirements for these APIs?

The provided information does not mention any authentication or authorization requirements for these APIs.

How can I handle errors when using these APIs?

When an error occurs, the APIs can return an 'Error' object in the response, which contains a 'code' (integer) and 'message' (string) property. You should handle these error responses appropriately in your application logic.

Can I sort or order the list of flowers returned by the GET '/flowers' endpoint?

The provided information does not mention any option for sorting or ordering the list of flowers returned by the GET '/flowers' endpoint.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for these APIs?

The provided information does not mention any rate limits or throttling mechanisms for these APIs.

How can I test or explore these APIs?

Since the provided information is visual documentation, you may need to set up a development environment or use tools like Postman or cURL to test and explore these APIs.
