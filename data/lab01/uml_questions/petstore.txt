    Description:
    This OpenAPI specification defines a set of APIs for managing pets. The APIs include endpoints for retrieving a list of pets (/pets), finding a specific pet by ID (/pets/{id}), adding a new pet (/pets), and deleting a pet (/pets/{id}). The GET /pets endpoint allows filtering the list of pets by tags and limiting the number of results. The POST /pets endpoint expects a request body containing the pet's name and tag properties. Successful responses include a 200 status code and the requested pet data, while errors are represented by appropriate HTTP status codes and an Error object containing an error code and message.
    - Number of routes/endpoints: 4 (GET /pets, GET /pets/{id}, POST /pets, DELETE /pets/{id})
- Number of request data models: 2 (NewPet, tags and limit query params)
- Number of response data models: 3 (Response, Pet, Error)
    
    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of these APIs?

These APIs allow users to manage a collection of pets by retrieving a list of pets, getting details of a specific pet, adding a new pet, and deleting an existing pet.

How do I retrieve a list of pets?

To retrieve a list of pets, send a GET request to the /pets endpoint. You can optionally include query parameters to filter the results by tags and limit the number of pets returned.

What are the required properties for adding a new pet?

To add a new pet, send a POST request to the /pets endpoint with a request body containing the pet's name (string) and tag (string array) properties.

How do I get details of a specific pet?

To get details of a specific pet, send a GET request to the /pets/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the pet you want to retrieve.

What HTTP status codes can the APIs return?

The APIs can return a 200 status code for successful responses, along with the requested data. In case of errors, appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server error) will be returned, along with an Error object containing an error code and message.

Can I filter the list of pets by tags?

Yes, when sending a GET request to the /pets endpoint, you can include a tags query parameter with a comma-separated list of tags to filter the pets by those tags.

How do I limit the number of pets returned in the list?

When sending a GET request to the /pets endpoint, you can include a limit query parameter with an integer value to specify the maximum number of pets to be returned in the response.

What data is returned when retrieving a list of pets?

When retrieving a list of pets via the GET /pets endpoint, the response will contain an array of Pet objects, each containing an id (integer) property.

What data is returned when retrieving a specific pet?

When retrieving a specific pet via the GET /pets/{id} endpoint, the response will contain a Pet object with properties such as id (integer), name (string), and tag (string array).

How do I delete a pet?

To delete a pet, send a DELETE request to the /pets/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the pet you want to delete. A successful response will have a 204 status code.

What happens if I try to retrieve a pet that doesn't exist?

If you send a GET request to the /pets/{id} endpoint with an ID that doesn't correspond to any existing pet, the API will return a 404 Not Found error, along with an Error object containing an error code and message.

Can I update an existing pet's information?

Based on the provided OpenAPI specification, there is no endpoint defined for updating an existing pet's information. The APIs only allow retrieving, adding, and deleting pets.

What is the expected format for the tags query parameter?

The tags query parameter should be a comma-separated list of strings, representing the tags you want to filter the pets by. For example, tags=tag1,tag2,tag3.

Is there a limit on the number of tags I can filter by?

The provided OpenAPI specification does not mention any limit on the number of tags that can be used for filtering the list of pets.

What happens if I try to add a pet with invalid or missing properties?

If you send a POST request to the /pets endpoint with invalid or missing properties in the request body, the API is likely to return an error response with an appropriate HTTP status code and an Error object containing details about the issue.

Can I sort the list of pets in a specific order?

The provided OpenAPI specification does not mention any query parameters or options for sorting the list of pets in a specific order.

Are there any rate limits or throttling applied to these APIs?

The provided OpenAPI specification does not mention any rate limits or throttling mechanisms for these APIs. However, it's a common practice to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

Is there any authentication or authorization required to use these APIs?

The provided OpenAPI specification does not mention any authentication or authorization requirements for using these APIs. However, in real-world scenarios, APIs often require some form of authentication and authorization to control access.

Are there any potential security risks or vulnerabilities to be aware of?

While the provided OpenAPI specification does not explicitly mention any security risks or vulnerabilities, it's important to follow best practices for API security, such as input validation, proper error handling, and protecting against common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, cross-site scripting, etc.).

Can I use these APIs to manage pets for multiple users or accounts?

The provided OpenAPI specification does not mention any user or account management functionality. The APIs seem to operate on a shared collection of pets, without any user or account separation. In a real-world scenario, APIs often include mechanisms for managing resources per user or account.
