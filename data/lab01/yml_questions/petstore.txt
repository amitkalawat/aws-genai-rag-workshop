    Description:
    The provided YAML file specifies a set of APIs for managing pets in a store. The APIs allow users to perform various operations, such as retrieving a list of pets, adding a new pet, fetching details of a specific pet, and deleting a pet.

The `/pets` endpoint supports two operations:

1. `GET /pets`: This operation retrieves a list of pets from the system that the user has access to. It supports optional query parameters `tags` and `limit`, which allow filtering the results by pet tags and limiting the number of returned pets, respectively. The response is an array of `Pet` objects.

2. `POST /pets`: This operation creates a new pet in the store. The request body should contain a `NewPet` object with the `name` and `tag` properties. The response is the created `Pet` object, including an automatically generated `id`.

The `/pets/{id}` endpoint also supports two operations:

3. `GET /pets/{id}`: This operation retrieves the details of a specific pet identified by the `id` path parameter. The response is a `Pet` object. If the requested pet is not found or the user does not have access to it, an error response is returned.

4. `DELETE /pets/{id}`: This operation deletes the pet identified by the `id` path parameter. If the deletion is successful, a '204 No Content' response is returned. Otherwise, an error response is returned.

The YAML file defines two data models: `Pet` and `NewPet`. The `Pet` model includes the `id`, `name`, and `tag` properties, while the `NewPet` model only includes the `name` and `tag` properties. The `Error` model is used for representing error responses and includes the `code` and `message` properties.

Potential errors that may be encountered include invalid request data, missing or invalid parameters, resource not found, and other unexpected errors. The error responses follow a consistent format with an `Error` object containing the error code and message.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of this API?

This API provides operations for managing pets in a pet store system. It allows users to retrieve a list of pets, add new pets, fetch details of a specific pet, and delete a pet.

How do I retrieve a list of pets?

You can use the `GET /pets` endpoint to retrieve a list of pets from the system. This endpoint supports optional query parameters `tags` and `limit` to filter the results by pet tags and limit the number of returned pets, respectively.

What is the expected response format for the list of pets?

The response for the `GET /pets` endpoint is an array of `Pet` objects. Each `Pet` object contains the `id`, `name`, and `tag` properties.

How do I add a new pet to the store?

To add a new pet, you can use the `POST /pets` endpoint. The request body should contain a `NewPet` object with the `name` and `tag` properties. The response will be the created `Pet` object, including an automatically generated `id`.

What is the difference between the `Pet` and `NewPet` models?

The `Pet` model includes the `id`, `name`, and `tag` properties, while the `NewPet` model only includes the `name` and `tag` properties. The `NewPet` model is used for creating a new pet, and the `Pet` model represents the complete pet object with an assigned `id`.

How do I retrieve details of a specific pet?

You can use the `GET /pets/{id}` endpoint to retrieve the details of a specific pet identified by its `id`. The `id` should be provided as a path parameter in the request URL.

What happens if the requested pet is not found or the user doesn't have access to it?

If the requested pet is not found or the user does not have access to it, the `GET /pets/{id}` endpoint will return an error response containing an `Error` object with the appropriate error code and message.

How do I delete a pet from the store?

To delete a pet, you can use the `DELETE /pets/{id}` endpoint, where `id` is the identifier of the pet you want to delete. If the deletion is successful, a '204 No Content' response will be returned. Otherwise, an error response will be returned.

What is the format of the error responses?

Error responses follow a consistent format with an `Error` object containing the `code` (integer) and `message` (string) properties. The `code` represents the error code, and the `message` provides a human-readable description of the error.

Are there any validations or constraints on the request data?

Yes, the YAML file specifies that the `name` property is required when creating a new pet (`NewPet` model). Additionally, the `id` parameter in the `GET /pets/{id}` and `DELETE /pets/{id}` endpoints is required and should be an integer in the int64 format.

Can I filter the list of pets by multiple tags?

Yes, the `GET /pets` endpoint supports filtering the results by multiple tags. The `tags` query parameter accepts an array of strings, where each string represents a tag to filter by.

What is the purpose of the `limit` query parameter in the `GET /pets` endpoint?

The `limit` query parameter in the `GET /pets` endpoint allows you to specify the maximum number of results to return. This can be useful when you want to retrieve a limited number of pets or implement pagination.

Can I update an existing pet's information?

The provided YAML file does not specify an endpoint for updating an existing pet's information. It only includes endpoints for retrieving, creating, and deleting pets.

Are duplicate pets allowed in the store?

Yes, the YAML file mentions that duplicates are allowed when creating a new pet (`POST /pets` endpoint).

What should I do if I encounter an unexpected error?

If you encounter an unexpected error while using these APIs, the response will contain an `Error` object with a generic error code and message. In such cases, you should refer to the API documentation or contact the API support team for further assistance.

Is there a way to retrieve information about the API itself, such as version or license?

Yes, the YAML file includes an `info` section that provides metadata about the API, such as the version, title, description, terms of service, contact information, and license details.

What is the base URL for these APIs?

The base URL for these APIs is specified in the `servers` section of the YAML file: `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2`.

Are there any additional resources or documentation available for these APIs?

The YAML file itself serves as the documentation for these APIs. It follows the OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification, which is a widely adopted standard for describing RESTful APIs. You can refer to the OpenAPI documentation or other resources related to the OpenAPI specification for more information.

Can I use these APIs in a production environment?

The provided YAML file is a sample API specification for demonstration purposes. Before using these APIs in a production environment, you should carefully review the documentation, test the APIs thoroughly, and ensure they meet your specific requirements and security standards.
