    Description:
    This YAML file describes a set of APIs for a Petstore application. The APIs allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on pet resources. The `/pets` endpoint supports GET and POST requests to retrieve and create pets, respectively. The `/pets/{id}` endpoint supports GET and DELETE requests to retrieve and delete a specific pet by ID. The APIs use JSON for request and response data formats. Requests may include query parameters (e.g., `tags`, `limit`) to filter or limit the results. Responses include relevant pet data or error details. Common error scenarios include invalid input, resource not found, and unexpected server errors.
    - Number of routes/endpoints: 3 (GET /pets, POST /pets, GET /pets/{id}, DELETE /pets/{id}). - Number of request data models: 1 (NewPet). - Number of response data models: 2 (Pet, Error). - Number of reusable data models: 2 (NewPet, Error).
    
    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of these APIs?

These APIs are designed for a Petstore application, allowing users to manage pet resources through CRUD operations.

How do I retrieve a list of all available pets?

Send a GET request to the `/pets` endpoint. You can optionally include query parameters like `tags` and `limit` to filter or limit the results.

What data is required to create a new pet?

To create a new pet, send a POST request to the `/pets` endpoint with a request body containing a JSON object that includes the `name` property (required) and optionally the `tag` property.

How do I retrieve details of a specific pet?

Send a GET request to the `/pets/{id}` endpoint, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the pet you want to retrieve.

Can I update an existing pet?

These APIs do not explicitly provide an endpoint for updating an existing pet. However, you can achieve this by first retrieving the pet data, making the desired changes, and then creating a new pet resource with the updated data.

How do I delete a pet?

Send a DELETE request to the `/pets/{id}` endpoint, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the pet you want to delete.

What happens if I try to retrieve a pet that doesn't exist?

If you attempt to retrieve a pet with an invalid or non-existent ID, the API will respond with an error message and an appropriate error code.

What data format is used for requests and responses?

These APIs use JSON for both request and response data formats.

Can I create multiple pets with the same name?

Yes, the API allows duplicates and does not enforce uniqueness of pet names.

How are errors represented in the API responses?

Error responses are represented using the `Error` data model, which includes a `code` (integer) and a `message` (string) property describing the error.

What is the purpose of the `tags` query parameter in the GET /pets endpoint?

The `tags` query parameter allows you to filter the list of returned pets based on one or more tags.

Is there a limit on the number of pets that can be retrieved?

Yes, you can use the `limit` query parameter in the GET /pets endpoint to specify the maximum number of results to return.

What data types are used for pet IDs?

Pet IDs are represented as 64-bit integers (format: int64).

Can I sort the list of pets retrieved from the GET /pets endpoint?

The API specification does not mention any sorting capabilities for the list of pets. The results are likely returned in an arbitrary order.

Are there any rate limits or throttling mechanisms in place for these APIs?

The API specification does not mention any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms. However, it is a common practice to implement such mechanisms to protect against abuse or excessive load.

How do I handle scenarios where the API returns an unexpected or unknown error?

In case of an unexpected or unknown error, the API will respond with a default error response containing an error code and message. You should handle these cases gracefully in your client application and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

Can I use these APIs to manage other resources besides pets, such as orders or customers?

The provided API specification only covers endpoints and data models related to managing pet resources. Additional functionality for other resources would require separate endpoints and data models.

Are there any security considerations or authentication mechanisms for these APIs?

The API specification does not mention any security or authentication mechanisms. In a production environment, you would typically implement measures like API keys, OAuth, or other authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the APIs.

How do I test or explore these APIs?

You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or curl to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints and inspect the responses. Many API documentation tools also provide interactive testing capabilities.

Are there any best practices or guidelines for consuming and working with these APIs?

Some general best practices include handling errors gracefully, following HTTP standards, using appropriate HTTP methods and status codes, and implementing caching and rate limiting mechanisms on the client side.
