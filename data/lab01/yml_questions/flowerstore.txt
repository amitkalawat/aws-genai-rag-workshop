    Description:
    The Flowershop API provides a set of endpoints for managing the operations of a flower shop. The `/flowers` endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all available flowers in the shop, with optional filtering by flower type and limiting the number of results. You can also add a new flower to the shop by sending a POST request to this endpoint with a `NewFlower` object in the request body. The `/flowers/{id}` endpoint enables you to retrieve details of a specific flower by its ID or delete a flower from the shop by sending a DELETE request with the flower's ID in the path parameter. The API responses are formatted in JSON and include relevant data models, such as `Flower`, `NewFlower`, and `Error`. Frequent errors may include invalid request parameters, missing required data, or requests for non-existent resources.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of the Flowershop API?

The Flowershop API provides a set of endpoints for managing the operations of a flower shop, such as retrieving lists of available flowers, adding new flowers, and deleting existing flowers.

How do I retrieve a list of all available flowers in the shop?

You can send a GET request to the `/flowers` endpoint to retrieve a list of all available flowers in the shop. The response will be a JSON array containing `Flower` objects.

Can I filter the list of flowers by type?

Yes, you can filter the list of flowers by type by including the `type` query parameter in your GET request to the `/flowers` endpoint. The `type` parameter accepts an array of string values representing the flower types you want to filter by.

How do I limit the number of flowers returned in the response?

You can include the `limit` query parameter in your GET request to the `/flowers` endpoint to specify the maximum number of flower results to return. The `limit` parameter accepts an integer value.

What data is required to add a new flower to the shop?

To add a new flower to the shop, you need to send a POST request to the `/flowers` endpoint with a `NewFlower` object in the request body. The `NewFlower` object must include the `name`, `type`, and `price` properties.

How do I retrieve details of a specific flower by its ID?

You can send a GET request to the `/flowers/{id}` endpoint, where `{id}` is the ID of the flower you want to retrieve. The response will be a `Flower` object containing the details of the requested flower.

What is the format of the flower ID in the `/flowers/{id}` endpoint?

The flower ID is an integer value in the int64 format.

How do I delete a flower from the shop?

To delete a flower from the shop, you need to send a DELETE request to the `/flowers/{id}` endpoint, where `{id}` is the ID of the flower you want to delete. If the request is successful, you will receive a 204 No Content response.

What is the structure of the `Error` response model?

The `Error` response model is an object with two required properties: `code` (an integer value) and `message` (a string value). This model is used to represent unexpected errors encountered during API requests.

What is the purpose of the `allOf` keyword in the `Flower` schema definition?

The `allOf` keyword is used to combine multiple schema definitions into a single schema. In the case of the `Flower` schema, it combines the `NewFlower` schema with an additional object containing the `id` property, which is required for existing flowers but not for new ones.

How do I know if a request was successful or not?

Successful requests will typically return a 200 OK or 204 No Content status code, depending on the endpoint and operation. If an error occurs, the API will return an appropriate error status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) and an `Error` object in the response body with details about the error.

What is the expected format of the `price` property in the `NewFlower` and `Flower` models?

The `price` property is a number in the float format, representing the price of the flower.

Can I use this API to update an existing flower's details?

No, the provided API specification does not include endpoints or operations for updating an existing flower's details. You can only retrieve, add, or delete flowers.

What is the purpose of the `servers` section in the OpenAPI specification?

The `servers` section defines the base URL for the API. In this case, the base URL is `https://api.example.com/v1`, which means all endpoint paths are relative to this base URL.

How can I test the Flowershop API before integrating it into my application?

You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or curl to send sample requests to the API endpoints and inspect the responses. This will help you understand the API's behavior and expected data formats.

What is the purpose of the `termsOfService`, `contact`, and `license` fields in the OpenAPI specification?

These fields provide additional metadata about the API, such as the terms of service URL, contact information for the API support team, and the license under which the API is provided.

Can I use this API to manage orders or inventory for the flower shop?

No, the provided API specification does not include endpoints or operations for managing orders or inventory. It is focused solely on managing the available flowers in the shop.

How can I provide feedback or report issues with the Flowershop API?

According to the `contact` information in the API specification, you can reach out to the API support team via email at `support@example.com` or by visiting the support URL at `https://example.com/support`.

What is the purpose of the `operationId` field in the endpoint definitions?

The `operationId` field is a unique string that identifies the operation being defined. It is used internally by API tooling and documentation generators and does not have a functional impact on the API itself.
