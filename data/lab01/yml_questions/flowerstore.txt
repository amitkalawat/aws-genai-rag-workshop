    Description:
    The Flowershop API is a set of endpoints for managing a flower shop's operations. The main functionalities include retrieving a list of available flowers, adding a new flower to the shop, fetching details of a specific flower by its ID, and deleting a flower by its ID.

The /flowers endpoint supports GET and POST requests. The GET request retrieves a list of all flowers available in the shop. It accepts optional query parameters 'type' (an array of flower types to filter by) and 'limit' (maximum number of results to return). The response is an array of 'Flower' objects. The POST request adds a new flower to the shop. It requires a request body containing a 'NewFlower' object with properties 'name', 'type', and 'price'. The response is the newly created 'Flower' object.

The /flowers/{id} endpoint supports GET and DELETE requests. The GET request fetches a specific flower by its ID, which is passed as a path parameter. The response is a 'Flower' object. The DELETE request deletes a flower by its ID, which is passed as a path parameter. A successful response has a 204 status code.

The API uses two main data models: 'Flower' and 'NewFlower'. 'Flower' inherits properties from 'NewFlower' and adds an 'id' property. 'Error' is a common response model for unexpected errors, containing a 'code' and 'message' property.

Potential limits and common errors include sending invalid or missing request data, querying for non-existent flower IDs, and server errors.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the Flowershop API?

The Flowershop API is a set of endpoints for managing a flower shop's operations, such as retrieving available flowers, adding new flowers, and deleting existing flowers.

How do I get a list of all available flowers?

To get a list of all available flowers, send a GET request to the /flowers endpoint. The response will be an array of 'Flower' objects.

Can I filter the list of flowers by type?

Yes, when sending a GET request to /flowers, you can pass a 'type' query parameter as an array of flower types to filter the results.

How do I add a new flower to the shop?

To add a new flower, send a POST request to the /flowers endpoint with a request body containing a 'NewFlower' object with properties 'name', 'type', and 'price'. The response will be the newly created 'Flower' object.

What properties does the 'NewFlower' object have?

The 'NewFlower' object has three required properties: 'name' (string), 'type' (string), and 'price' (number).

How do I get details of a specific flower?

To get details of a specific flower, send a GET request to the /flowers/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the flower you want to fetch. The response will be a 'Flower' object.

How do I delete a flower from the shop?

To delete a flower, send a DELETE request to the /flowers/{id} endpoint, replacing {id} with the ID of the flower you want to delete. A successful response will have a 204 status code.

What happens if I try to fetch or delete a non-existent flower ID?

If you try to fetch or delete a flower with an ID that doesn't exist in the shop, the API will respond with an 'Error' object containing an error code and message.

What is the 'Error' response model used for?

The 'Error' response model is used to represent unexpected errors that may occur during the API requests. It contains a 'code' (integer) and 'message' (string) property to describe the error.

Can I limit the number of results returned in the flower list?

Yes, when sending a GET request to /flowers, you can pass a 'limit' query parameter with an integer value to limit the maximum number of results returned.

What HTTP methods are supported by the Flowershop API?

The Flowershop API supports the GET, POST, and DELETE HTTP methods.

What is the base URL for the Flowershop API?

The base URL for the Flowershop API is https://api.example.com/v1, as specified in the 'servers' section of the OpenAPI specification.

What is the 'operationId' field used for in the OpenAPI specification?

The 'operationId' field is a unique string that identifies an operation in the API. It is used internally by code generation tools and documentation tools.

What is the purpose of the 'components' section in the OpenAPI specification?

The 'components' section in the OpenAPI specification defines reusable data models, such as the 'Flower', 'NewFlower', and 'Error' models used by the API.

How are data models defined in the OpenAPI specification?

Data models in the OpenAPI specification are defined using JSON Schema. For example, the 'Flower' model inherits properties from the 'NewFlower' model and adds an 'id' property.

What is the difference between a path parameter and a query parameter?

A path parameter is a variable value that is part of the endpoint URL, such as the {id} in /flowers/{id}. A query parameter is an optional parameter passed in the query string of the URL, such as ?type=rose&limit=10.

What is the purpose of the 'required' field in a data model definition?

The 'required' field in a data model definition specifies which properties are mandatory for that model. For example, the 'NewFlower' model requires the 'name', 'type', and 'price' properties.

What is the purpose of the 'termsOfService', 'contact', and 'license' fields in the OpenAPI specification?

The 'termsOfService', 'contact', and 'license' fields provide metadata about the API, such as its terms of service, contact information for support, and licensing information.

Can I use the Flowershop API for commercial purposes?

The OpenAPI specification states that the Flowershop API is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. You would need to review the terms of this license to determine if it allows commercial use.

Where can I find more information about the OpenAPI specification?

The OpenAPI specification is an open-source standard maintained by the OpenAPI Initiative. You can find more information, documentation, and tools on their official website: https://www.openapis.org/
