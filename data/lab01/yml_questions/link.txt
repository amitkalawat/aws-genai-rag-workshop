    Description:
    This set of APIs provides functionality for managing users, repositories, and pull requests on a code hosting platform. The `/2.0/users/{username}` endpoint retrieves information about a user, including their username and uuid, along with a link to their repositories. The `/2.0/repositories/{username}` endpoint retrieves a list of repositories owned by a user, with links to individual repository details. The `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}` endpoint retrieves details of a specific repository, including its owner and a link to its pull requests. The `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests` endpoint retrieves a list of pull requests for a repository, filtered by their state (open, merged, or declined). The `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests/{pid}` endpoint retrieves details of a specific pull request, including its title, repository, author, and a link to merge it. The `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests/{pid}/merge` endpoint allows merging a pull request. Common errors may include invalid usernames, repository slugs, or pull request IDs, as well as unauthorized access or merge conflicts.

How do I retrieve pull requests for a repository?

You can use the `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests` endpoint to retrieve a list of pull requests for a repository, filtered by their state (open, merged, or declined).

What information is included in the pull request details?

The pull request details include the pull request ID, title, repository information, and author information.

How do I retrieve a specific pull request?

You can use the `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests/{pid}` endpoint to retrieve details of a specific pull request, including its title, repository, author, and a link to merge it.

How do I merge a pull request?

You can use the `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests/{pid}/merge` endpoint to merge a pull request.

What types of errors can occur when using these APIs?

Common errors may include invalid usernames, repository slugs, or pull request IDs, as well as unauthorized access or merge conflicts.

What data models are used in the responses?

The responses use three data models: user (containing username and uuid), repository (containing slug and owner), and pullrequest (containing id, title, repository, and author).

Are there any request data models?

No, there are no request data models defined in the provided YAML file.

How are links between resources represented?

Links between resources are represented using the `links` property in the responses, which reference link components defined in the `components/links` section of the YAML file.

What is the purpose of the link components?

The link components define the operations and parameters required to retrieve related resources, such as a user's repositories, a repository's pull requests, or a pull request's merge operation.

Can I filter pull requests by their state?

Yes, the `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests` endpoint accepts a `state` query parameter that can be set to `open`, `merged`, or `declined` to filter the pull requests accordingly.

What is the format of the response for the user endpoint?

The response for the `/2.0/users/{username}` endpoint is in JSON format, containing a user object with properties `username` and `uuid`, as defined in the `#/components/schemas/user` schema.

What is the format of the response for the repository list endpoint?

The response for the `/2.0/repositories/{username}` endpoint is a JSON array, where each element is a repository object as defined in the `#/components/schemas/repository` schema.

What is the format of the response for the pull request list endpoint?

The response for the `/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests` endpoint is a JSON array, where each element is a pull request object as defined in the `#/components/schemas/pullrequest` schema.

How do I access the properties of the response objects?

You can access the properties of the response objects using the appropriate keys defined in the corresponding schemas. For example, `$response.body#/username` would access the `username` property of a user object in the response.

Are there any rate limits or usage restrictions for these APIs?

The YAML file does not specify any rate limits or usage restrictions for these APIs. However, it is common for APIs to have such limits, which should be documented separately.
