    Description:
    The Bookstore API provides a set of endpoints for managing books and authors in an online bookstore. The API allows listing all available books and authors, as well as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting individual books and authors. The book data includes properties such as title, author, description, and publication date. The author data includes properties like name and biography. Requests to create or update books and authors require providing the necessary data in the request body. Successful responses typically include the created or updated resource data in JSON format. There may be limits on the number of resources that can be retrieved or created at once. Common errors may include invalid request data, missing required fields, or attempting to access non-existent resources.

    FAQ:
    
    What is the purpose of the Bookstore API?

The Bookstore API is designed to provide a set of endpoints for managing books and authors in an online bookstore. It allows clients to perform various operations such as listing, creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting books and authors.

How do I get a list of all available books?

To get a list of all available books, you can send a GET request to the '/books' endpoint. The response will contain an array of book objects with properties like id, title, author, description, and published date.

What information is required to create a new book?

To create a new book, you need to send a POST request to the '/books' endpoint with a request body containing a 'BookInput' object. The required properties are 'title' and 'authorId'. Optionally, you can provide a 'description' and 'published' date.

How do I update an existing book?

To update an existing book, you need to send a PUT request to the '/books/{bookId}' endpoint, where '{bookId}' is the ID of the book you want to update. The request body should contain a 'BookInput' object with the updated properties.

What happens if I try to delete a non-existent book or author?

If you attempt to delete a book or author that does not exist, the API will likely return a 404 Not Found error, indicating that the requested resource could not be found.

Can I retrieve a single author by ID?

Yes, you can retrieve a single author by sending a GET request to the '/authors/{authorId}' endpoint, where '{authorId}' is the ID of the author you want to retrieve.

What is the expected response format for the API?

The expected response format for the Bookstore API is JSON. For successful responses, the API will return the requested resource(s) in JSON format, following the defined response data models ('Book' or 'Author').

How do I handle errors from the API?

The API uses HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. In case of errors, the API will return an appropriate error status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) and may include additional error information in the response body.

Are there any limits on the number of resources I can retrieve or create?

The API documentation does not specify any explicit limits on the number of resources that can be retrieved or created. However, it's possible that the API implementation may impose certain limits for performance or security reasons.

Can I filter or sort the list of books or authors?

The current API specification does not mention any filtering or sorting capabilities for the list of books or authors. If such functionality is required, it would need to be added to the API implementation and documented accordingly.

What is the purpose of the 'termsOfService' and 'license' fields in the API specification?

The 'termsOfService' and 'license' fields provide additional information about the API. 'termsOfService' typically contains a link to the terms and conditions for using the API, while 'license' specifies the license under which the API is provided (in this case, Apache 2.0).

How do I handle pagination for large datasets?

The API specification does not mention any pagination mechanisms. If the number of books or authors is large, it may be necessary to implement pagination on the server-side and provide additional parameters or headers to support pagination in the API responses.

Can I perform any operations related to book reviews or ratings?

The current API specification does not include any endpoints or data models related to book reviews or ratings. If such functionality is required, it would need to be added to the API implementation and documented accordingly.

What is the purpose of the 'operationId' field in the API specification?

The 'operationId' field is a unique string used to identify each operation (endpoint) in the API specification. It can be used for various purposes, such as generating code or documentation for the API.

How do I handle authentication and authorization for the API?

The provided API specification does not include any information about authentication or authorization mechanisms. Depending on the specific requirements, the API implementation may need to incorporate authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth) and authorization mechanisms to secure the endpoints.

Can I create or update multiple books or authors in a single request?

Based on the current API specification, there are no endpoints or operations that allow creating or updating multiple books or authors in a single request. Each book or author needs to be created or updated individually through separate requests.

What is the purpose of the 'components' section in the API specification?

The 'components' section in the API specification defines reusable data models, schemas, and other components that can be referenced throughout the API specification. In this case, it defines the 'Book', 'BookInput', 'Author', and 'AuthorInput' schemas used in the request and response bodies.

How do I handle versioning for the API?

The API specification includes a 'version' field (set to '1.0.0') in the 'info' section. This version number can be used for versioning the API. However, the specification does not provide details on how versioning is implemented or how to access different versions of the API.

Can I perform any operations related to book categories or genres?

The current API specification does not include any endpoints or data models related to book categories or genres. If such functionality is required, it would need to be added to the API implementation and documented accordingly.

How do I test the API endpoints during development?

The API specification does not provide any information about testing or development environments. To test the API endpoints during development, you may need to set up a local or dedicated testing environment with the API implementation running, and then send requests to the appropriate endpoints.
