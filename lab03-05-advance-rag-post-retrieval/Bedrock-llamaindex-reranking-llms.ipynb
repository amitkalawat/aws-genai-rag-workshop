It is costly to establish,develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on asustained basis.In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:•local economic and political conditions;•government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as tradeprotection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;•restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, includinguncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practicesregarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;•business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;•limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;•limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;•shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;•laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, payments,advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;•lower levels of use of the Internet;•lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.</td>\n",

We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell.Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when webegin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, andaccurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not bereturnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sellproducts in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adverselyaffect our operating results.We Are Subject to Payments-Related RisksWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, directdebit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offerto our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations toimplement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. Forcertain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs andlower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing ofcredit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing.</td>\n",
