    "Reranking is a crucial post-retrieval process that refines the initial set of retrieved documents to improve the relevance and quality of information used for generating responses. After the initial retrieval step, which typically uses methods like vector similarity search, reranking takes the retrieved documents and re-scores their relevance to the query using more sophisticated techniques. These may include cross-encoders, BERT-based models, or other advanced algorithms that can better capture semantic nuances and context. Based on these scores, the documents are reordered, pushing the most relevant and informative ones to the top, thereby enhancing the accuracy and contextual appropriateness of the final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will highlight the usage of an existing LLM (for example Bedrock Claude3 Haiku) as a reranker model to improve the relevance of the documents retrieved from Amazon SEC filings. We also utilized the Bedrock Claude-3 Sonnet model and the Bedrock Titan Text Embedding v2.0 model for natural language processing and document embeddings to build this RAG system. The key steps were: ingesting PDF documents into a vector database index, retrieving top relevant nodes based on a query using semantic search, reranking the retrieved nodes using the fine-tuned transformer model deployed on SageMaker, and synthesizing a final response consolidating the reranked information. See below image for details.\n",

We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell.Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when webegin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, andaccurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not bereturnable.

For example, productivity acrossour fulfillment network currently is being affected by regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, which increase payroll costs and make itdifficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like.Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory andoperating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventoryfulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillmentnetwork or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers.
