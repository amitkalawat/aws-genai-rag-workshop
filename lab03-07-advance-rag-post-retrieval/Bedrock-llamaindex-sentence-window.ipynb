    "# RAG Retrieval Optimization - Sentence Window Parsing technique with Amazon Bedrock and Llamaindex\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence window is another technique that enhances the retrieval process by focusing on individual sentences while providing surrounding context. In this approach, documents are parsed into single sentences, each with a \"window\" of surrounding sentences. During retrieval, the system finds the most relevant individual sentences. However, instead of using only these single sentences, it replaces them with their corresponding windows, which include a specified number of sentences before and after the retrieved sentence. This method allows for more fine-grained retrieval of specific information while still providing necessary context, potentially improving the relevance and coherence of the generated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we demonstrated how to use sentence window technique for post-retrieval with LlamaIndex. Specifically, we employed the SentenceWindowNodeParser module to splits Amazon's SEC filing documents into individual sentences, creating a node for each sentence while also including a configurable \"window\" of surrounding sentences in the node's metadata. We can then use the MetadataReplacementPostProcessor module to retrieve the sentence along with associated 'window' metadata to improve the context for final response generation.\n",
