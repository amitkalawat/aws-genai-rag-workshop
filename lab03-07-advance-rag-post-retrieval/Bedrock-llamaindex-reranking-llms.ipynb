    "Reranking is a crucial post-retrieval process that refines the initial set of retrieved documents to improve the relevance and quality of information used for generating responses. After the initial retrieval step, which typically uses methods like vector similarity search, reranking takes the retrieved documents and re-scores their relevance to the query using more sophisticated techniques. These may include cross-encoders, BERT-based models, or other advanced algorithms that can better capture semantic nuances and context. Based on these scores, the documents are reordered, pushing the most relevant and informative ones to the top, thereby enhancing the accuracy and contextual appropriateness of the final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will highlight the usage of Bedrock Reranker LLMs (for example Cohere Rerank 3.5) as a reranker model to improve the relevance of the documents retrieved from Amazon SEC filings. We also utilized the Bedrock Nova Pro model and the Bedrock Titan Text Embedding v2.0 model for natural language processing and document embeddings to build this RAG system. The key steps were: ingesting PDF documents into a vector database index, retrieving top relevant nodes based on a query using semantic search, reranking the retrieved nodes using the fine-tuned transformer model deployed on SageMaker, and synthesizing a final response consolidating the reranked information. See below image for details.\n",

Additionally, the loss of executive officers or other key employees, challenges in hiring and retaining qualified personnel, and labor union efforts to organize employees pose significant risks.
