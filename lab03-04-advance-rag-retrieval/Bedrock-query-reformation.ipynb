    "Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases now suppport query reformulation for complex user input queries. This feature can take a complex input query and break it into multiple sub-queries. These sub-queries will then separately go through their own retrieval steps to find relevant chunks. In this process, the subqueries having less semantic complexity might find more targeted chunks. These chunks will then be pooled and ranked together before passing them to the FM to generate a response.\n",
